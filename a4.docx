Line 1: import tkinter as tk

This line imports the tkinter module, which is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It's a standard library module that provides a way to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python. The as tk part assigns the alias tk to the tkinter module, so we can use tk instead of tkinter to access its components.

Line 14: self.buttons = [tk.Button(self.root, text="", font=("normal",25), width=6, height=2, command=lambda i=i: self.button_click(i)) for i in range(9)]

This line creates a list of 9 buttons using a list comprehension. Each button is created with the tk.Button class, and its properties are set as follows: * text="": The button's text is initially empty. * font=("normal",25): The button's font is set to a normal font with size 25. * width=6 and height=2: The button's width and height are set to 6 and 2, respectively. * command=lambda i=i: self.button_click(i): The button's command is set to a lambda function that calls the button_click method with the button's index as an argument.

Line 15: for i, button in enumerate(self.buttons):

This line iterates over the list of buttons using the enumerate function, which returns both the index and the value of each element.

Line 16: button.grid(row=i // 3, column=i % 3)

This line places each button in a grid layout using the grid method. The row and column indices are calculated using integer division and modulo operations.

Line 17: self.label = tk.Label(self.root, text=f"Player {self.current_player}'s turn", font=("normal", 16))

This line creates a label to display the current player's turn.

Line 18: self.label.grid(row=3, column=0, columnspan=3)

This line places the label in the grid layout.

This line defines the check_winner method.

Line 20-27: for combo in [[0,1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8],[0,3,6],[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[0,4,8],[2,4,6]]:

This line iterates over a list of winning combinations.

Line 28: `if self.buttons[combo[0]]["text"] == self.buttons[combo[1]]["text"] == self.buttons[combo[2]]["text"] != "":
